*** TODO (first)

*** TO TEST

- pgrof: test with more than 100k entries

*** TODO

- find . -type f -name "*.[cly]" -exec grep -n ' \* TODO' /dev/null {} \;
- document server::https and .htaccess switchs (https/auth)
- cache::loadCache() do not need to load extraction metadata

*** TODO MAYBE

- find . -type f -name "*.[cly]" -exec grep -n ' \* MAYBE' /dev/null {} \;
- simplify code: is loadCollection alway need EXTR (to use getArchive) ?
- simplify code: is cleanCacheTree() dead code ?
- remove \) from extractFile.l : 'STRING  [^[:blank:]\)\n\r]{1,511}' ?
- add lexems for '<<<<<<<' to detect git conflicts

- no more use own malloc into mediatex (still usefull for other client)
- refuse "^../" as content extraction rule
- manage ECDSA keys
- hook for ~mdtx-hello/cvs/scripts/deliver.sh and cgi templates
- test an apache configuration using claim-based authentication (openId)
- move dirname into extract rule header to reduce metadata size
