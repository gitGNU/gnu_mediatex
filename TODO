*** TO CORRECT: cache policy    

- incomings TTL into servers.txt
- add supp to coll remove INC entry from extract.txt -> parser staf ?

- upload (manage all 5-E-C combinaisons) -> concat into NNN.txt
- score computation also use md5sums.txt file
- motd: add to burn and orphanes
- catalogHtml: add warning for orphanes

- cache/toKeep directory: 
-- rename to cache/extern
-- replace path on extraction
-- follow simlinks
-- md5sum not computed all times

- move dirname into extract rule header to reduce extract.txt file size
-- extract.c::extractTar modify asso->path -> getAssoPath()
-- extractFile.y: container: extrTYPE archive ++extrSTRING
-- extractTree.h: struct Container { ++char* pathPrefix;
-- memory/utFunc.c
-- misc/extract000.txt

- do not notify archive when nbGeo remote copies exists or not ?
--> ease user copy as all servers get the archive
