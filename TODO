*** TO CORRECT: cache policy    

** SERVER API:
.........................................................

** SERVER
- serversTree->server[]->lastCommit = DATE used by computeScore

** UPLOAD
- rename cache/incoming/date to cache/date
- provide upload target path
- do not load into cache unknown archive from extract.txt
- isIncoming() &&= (archive->mainScore ==-1 || archive->mainScore <= 5)
- simulate extraction and check md5sum from content ?

** FINALE-SUPLLY
- add a sha1 field for supports ?
- supports also include files on disk:
-- name = absolute path 
- cache.c also read supports.txt to get final-supply records
- remove cache/toKeep directory
- cache never follow simlinks

** MOTD
- localScore/mainScore ?
- add coll selection facility
- add to burn
-- only show when mainScore<5 && localScore<5
-- list embedded content too if not all having same score
- notify orphanes
- display cache size (all/used/allocated/free)

** HTML
- notify server lastComit
- (final supplies automaticaly included into image score computation)
- notify orphanes

** LOGS
- make cron upload the cvsroot collection module
- make cron upload the collection's apache logs
- ease looking for archive life cycle into cvsroot

** TRUST
- new client query: mdtc check content [coll COLL]
-- generate a content file (from extraction rules)
-- register a special order+mail
-- deliver maintain the content file (delete lines on succes)
-- ... and finaly end it to the mail address
- buildRule.sh script

*** CHANGES (to document)

** INC
- extractNNN.txt: agregate uploaded files into one uniq INC container
--> computeArchiveStatus => ComputeExtractScore
- REC code removed
- score: look INC date to decide if score inpact or not on collection
- no unit test for extract.c::getWantedArchives
- extract.c::extractRecord modify tmpBasename for INC
- uploadTTL parmeter into servers.txt
- extract rule automatically remove related INC content

** HAVE
- have: mount done by server
- mediatexd (ex: have) do not pass log facility to mdtx (but scripts ok)
- find a way to pass a string for have/upload recordTree messages
- remove [info cache.c] access fails: No such file or directory
- remove thereIs function

** UPLOAD
- cvsPrint manage upload concatenation
- upload (manage all 5-E-C combinaisons) -> concat into NNN.txt

** SYNTAX
- finale -> final
- locale -> local / setlocale / LOCALEDIR / locale.h

** SERVER API
- simplify cgiSrv code
- add a function to log recordTree (into recordTree.c)
- move env.dryRun test into connect.c (notify, cgi, supp, upload)
- move isRechable into utserverTree (never used elsewhere)

- call logRecordTree into unit-tests (instead of utLog)
- send all sockets messages into mediatexd (cache, have, cgiSrv, notify)
--  only in cgiSrv.c (why) 
  if (connexion->sock != STDOUT_FILENO && 
      shutdown(connexion->sock, SHUT_WR) == -1) {
- meditexd add -X- module into return code
- check messages servers unit tests (cache, cgiSrv, have, notify)
- have.sh: use $PWD instead of a copy on /tmp (cf cache.sh)
- test for cgi POST query
- unit test for notify (receiving message)
- skip alloc when putting default severity to debug
- unit test for mediatexd (sockets messages)
-- move readMessageinto thread.c
-- add utmediatexd.c calling this function
