*** TODO

- update : check if bind available (daemon is up)
  ex: make audit works ...mdtxScp fails...

- sort files on message of the day
   apache_20160107_fred.narval.tk.log.gz ( 0.00)
   apache_20160106_fred.narval.tk.log.gz ( 0.00)

- manage http port into mdtx.conf's collection stanza
-- mdtx.conf: httpPort, httpsPort
-- servers.txt: doHttps yes/no
-- htaccess: sslDoCypherSsl

- change logo.png to logo
- add an apache alias for '~' as it is not on mac keyboard

*** BUGS

- manage moving path into the cache (as now, archives renamed are removed)
- server scan (done at startup, but not on reload)
- add uploaded server's log into a uniq document and move information on archive description
- add coll and then HUP daemon (that need to be restarted) :
  try to parse servers.txt but serv1 still do no belongs to serv1-hello.
  (todo: try to use ACL to resolve it)

*** TO TEST

- pgrof: test with more than 100k entries

*** TODO

- find . -type f -name "*.[cly]" -exec grep -n ' \* TODO' /dev/null {} \;
- mediatex log|top|start|stop|hup/reload|scan
- manage new group without reloading server (using setfacl)
- speed-up cache scanning process (use an hash table on records)
- speed-up audit building process (maybe handle report in C)
- serialise b-tree using another order and use add-if-not-there function
- replace cvs+viewvc by git+cgit
- replace gethostby*_r by getaddrinfo and co
- optimise cache.c::freeCache (ex: sort on dates)
- i10n for french

- src/misc/md5sums.c -> checksums.c
- move date parser/serialiser code into perm.c
- refuse "^../" as content extraction rule
- manage ECDSA keys
- remove MDTX_DELIVER code?: register.h ... mediatexd.c
- hook for ~mdtx-hello/cvs/scripts/deliver.sh
