*** BUGS

- add a switch to cvs backups and apache logs into servers.txt
- sort files on message of the day
   apache_20160107_fred.narval.tk.log.gz ( 0.00)
   apache_20160106_fred.narval.tk.log.gz ( 0.00)
- manage accents into cache filenames (cgi should rewrite URLs)
- manage moving path into the cache (as now, archives renamed are removed)
- force http for "Version", "Cache hosts" and cgi replyed URL urls as https is forced by htaccess when needed
- add an apache alias for '~' as it is not on mac keyboard
- change logo.png to logo
- add server's log into a uniq document and move information on archive description
- add coll and then HUP daemon (that need to be restarted) :
  try to parse servers.txt but serv1 still do no belongs to serv1-hello.
  (todo: try to use ACL to resolve it)

- manage new group without reloading server (using setfacl)
- speed-up cache scanning process (use an hash table on records)
