- add DNS roundrobbin hostname into logo (servers.txt)

- sort files on message of the day
   apache_20160107_fred.narval.tk.log.gz ( 0.00)
   apache_20160106_fred.narval.tk.log.gz ( 0.00)

- test14 : motd ask for file support

- test21: audit fails (rc=4 ?)
  never fails with SERVER=1 ?
  not alway reproductible with SERVER=0
  md5sum computed but not checked (audit will alway success !)

*** TO TEST

- pgrof: test with more than 100k entries

*** TODO

- find . -type f -name "*.[cly]" -exec grep -n ' \* TODO' /dev/null {} \;
- replace cvs+viewvc by git+cgit
- mediatex log|top|start|stop|hup/reload|scan
- speed-up cache scanning process (btree on archives)
- speed-up audit building process (I hope btree on archive already do it)
- serialise b-tree using another order and use add-if-not-there function
- optimise cache.c::freeCache (ex: sort on sizes / related to btree order)
- i10n for french

*** TODO MAYBE

- find . -type f -name "*.[cly]" -exec grep -n ' \* MAYBE' /dev/null {} \;
- src/misc/md5sums.c -> checksums.c
- add an apache alias for '~' as it is not on mac keyboard
- move date parser/serialiser code into perm.c
- refuse "^../" as content extraction rule
- manage ECDSA keys
- remove MDTX_DELIVER code?: register.h ... mediatexd.c
- hook for ~mdtx-hello/cvs/scripts/deliver.sh and cgi templates
- monitor cache sizes: all/used/allocated/free
- test an apache configuration using claim-based authentication (openId)
- move dirname into extract rule header to reduce metadata size
- add supp: wait CD doors is locked
- manage accents into cache filenames (cgi should rewrite URLs)
   Content-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8 ?
- ease several servers conf: manage /etc/init.d, cron... from adm init
- replace gethostby*_r by getaddrinfo and co
- replace ardsm by mqueue
