*** TO TEST

- pgrof: test with more than 100k entries

*** TODO

- find . -type f -name "*.[cly]" -exec grep -n ' \* TODO' /dev/null {} \;
- manage new group without reloading server (using setfacl)
- speed-up cache scanning process (use an hash table on records)
- speed-up audit building process (maybe handle report in C)
- serialise b-tree using another order and use add-if-not-there function
- replace cvs+viewvc by git+cgit
- replace gethostby*_r by getaddrinfo and co
- optimise cache.c::freeCache (ex: sort on dates)
- i10n for french

*** TODO MAYBE

- find . -type f -name "*.[cly]" -exec grep -n ' \* MAYBE' /dev/null {} \;
- src/misc/md5sums.c -> checksums.c
- move date parser/serialiser code into perm.c
- refuse "^../" as content extraction rule
- manage ECDSA keys
- remove MDTX_DELIVER code?: register.h ... mediatexd.c
- hook for ~mdtx-hello/cvs/scripts/deliver.sh
- monitor cache sizes: all/used/allocated/free
- test an apache configuration using claim-based authentication (openId)
- move dirname into extract rule header to reduce extract.txt file size
- add supp: wait CD doors is locked
- ease several servers conf: manage /etc/init.d, cron... from adm init
- replace ardsm by mqueue
- add thread ID to the log
