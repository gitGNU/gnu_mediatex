*** TO CORRECT: cache policy    
.........................................................

** POST-TEST
- !wanted ne s'efface pas quand serv2 fait l'extraction
  a priori il faudrait que le serv1 le récupère et notifie serv2

** FINALE-SUPLLY
- supports also include files on disk:
-- name = absolute path 
- cache.c also read supports.txt to get final-supply records

** MOTD
- check final-supplies saved on disk
- localScore/mainScore ?
- isIncoming() &&= (archive->mainScore ==-1 || archive->mainScore <= 5)
- add coll selection facility
- add to burn
-- only show when mainScore<5 && localScore<5
-- list embedded content too if not all having same score
- notify orphanes
- display cache size (all/used/allocated/free)

** HTML
- notify server lastCommit
- (final supplies automaticaly included into image score computation)
- notify orphanes

** LOGS
- make cron upload the cvsroot collection module
- make cron upload the collection's apache logs
- ease looking for archive life cycle into cvsroot

** TRUST
- serversTree->server[]->lastCommit = DATE used by computeScore
- new client query: mdtx audit [coll COLL] for MAIL
-- generate a content file (from extraction rules)
-- register FINAL_DEMAND with extra "audit:nroche@narval.tk"
-- deliver maintain the content file (checksum and delete lines on succes)
-- ... and finaly send it to the mail address and upload it
- buildRule.sh script

** DOC
- gdb mdtx: remove setuid bit and run it as root

*** CHANGES (to document)

** INC
- extractNNN.txt: agregate uploaded files into one uniq INC container
--> computeArchiveStatus => ComputeExtractScore
- REC code removed
- score: look INC date to decide if score inpact or not on collection
- no unit test for extract.c::getWantedArchives
- extract.c::extractRecord modify tmpBasename for INC
- uploadTTL parmeter into servers.txt
- extract rule automatically remove related INC content

** HAVE
- have: mount done by server
- mediatexd (ex: have) do not pass log facility to mdtx (but scripts ok)
- find a way to pass a string for have/upload recordTree messages
- remove [info cache.c] access fails: No such file or directory
- remove thereIs function

** UPLOAD
- cvsPrint manage upload concatenation
- upload (manage all 5-E-C combinaisons) -> concat into NNN.txt
- rename cache/incoming/date to cache/date
- provide upload target path
- move callAccess, makeDir, removeDir and extractCp from cache to extract
- dedicated server module for upload
- extract: get uniq path on directory too (if a file have directory name)
- remove cache/toKeep directory
- cache never follow simlinks
- do not load into cache unknown archive from extract.txt

** SYNTAX
- finale -> final
- locale -> local / setlocale / LOCALEDIR / locale.h

** SERVER API
- simplify cgiSrv code
- add a function to log recordTree (into recordTree.c)
- move env.dryRun test into connect.c (notify, cgi, supp, upload)
- move isRechable into utserverTree (never used elsewhere)
- call logRecordTree into unit-tests (instead of utLog)
- send all sockets messages into mediatexd (cache, have, cgiSrv, notify)
--  only in cgiSrv.c (why) 
  if (connexion->sock != STDOUT_FILENO && 
      shutdown(connexion->sock, SHUT_WR) == -1) {
- meditexd add -X- module into return code
- check messages servers unit tests (cache, cgiSrv, have, notify)
- have.sh: use $PWD instead of a copy on /tmp (cf cache.sh)
- test for cgi POST query
- unit test for notify (receiving message)
- skip alloc when putting default severity to debug
- unit test for mediatexd (sockets messages)
-- move readMessageinto thread.c
-- add utmediatexd.c calling this function

*** CLEAN-UP

- src/misc/host.c (to remove)
- src/misc/udp.c (to remove)
- compilation warnings

*** TO TEST

- pgrof: test with more than 100k entries
- find historical event into cvs's collections

*** TODO

- find . -type f -name "*.[cly]" -exec grep -n ' \* TODO' /dev/null {} \;
- add a sha1 field for supports
- move extract.c into common/extractRules.c so as to run it during upload
-- cacheSet and delverArchive must also be defined into client
- replace gethostby*_r by getaddrinfo and co
- optimise cache.c::freeCache (sort on date)
- i10n for french

*** TODO MAYBE

- find . -type f -name "*.[cly]" -exec grep -n ' \* MAYBE' /dev/null {} \;
- refuse "^../" as content extraction rule
- manage ECDSA keys
- remove MDTX_DELIVER code?: register.h ... mediatexd.c
- move dirname into extract rule header to reduce extract.txt file size
- add supp: wait CD doors is locked (cf v3)
- ease several servers conf: manage /etc/init.d, cron... from adm init
  vhost for apache logs and one mdtx.log for each daemon
- replace ardsm by mqueue
- add thread ID to the log
- replace cvs+viewvc by git+cgit
