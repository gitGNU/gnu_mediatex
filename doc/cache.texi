@cindex cache

@process{Cache} process manage the local server cache's directory.

@note: in order to not delete unsafe archives, @process{Cache} compute
archive's scores using the same algorithm as @procClientServ{} based on image's score provided by @dataServers{}.

@process{Cache} use 3 options defined into the 
@dataConf{} file:
@table @code
@item cacheSize
the maximum size that limit growing operations into the cache
@item cacheTTL
the minimum time a file notified to 
@actorUser{} has to be keept into the cache
@item queryTTL
the time to live of a @actorUserO{} query is kept into the
@dataChecksum{} file
@end table

Process conceptual model:

@image{mediatex-figures/cache,,,,}

@itemize @bullet

@item Events in
@table @code
@item @eventServerCacheAlloc{} 
from @procServerExtract{}: allocate place into the cache.

@end table
@item Processing

@itemize @bullet
@item Scan the cache directory @file{~mdtx/cache/mdtx-COLL} without following symlinks.
@item Compute available and frozen (unsafe archive) spaces.
@item Remove safe archives when more place is needed for allocation.
@item Reserve space for newly allocated archives (during extract or upload)
