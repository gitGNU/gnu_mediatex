@cindex Motd

The @process{Motd} process display the list of supports
the @mediatexO{} system wants to check or extract for,
and the archives that needs to be put on external supports to be safe.

Process conceptual model:

@process{Motd} use 3 options defined into the  @dataConf{} file:
@table @code
@item checkTTL 
The time interval we have to re-check supports before @mediatexO{} considers them obsolete (In this case, scores are impacted now ; but you ever can provide the support after and recover your previous scores).
@item fileTTL
Twice the time interval @mediatexO{} will automatically re-check support's files.
@item motdPolicy
Set to ``All'' if all images must be retrieve localy. Default is 'Most' to only retrieve localy images having a bad score.
@end table

@itemize @bullet
@item Events in
@table @code

@item @eventClientMotd
from @procScriptsCron{}

@end table
@item Processing

Ask @actorPublisherO{} for:
@itemize @bullet
@item supports not seen for a while (and so having no score computed),
@item supports needed to extract local or remote remands,
@item cache content to put on external supports.
@end itemize

@item Events out
@table @code

@item @eventServerSaveReg{} 
to @activityServer{}: ask @activityServer{} to dump its state into disk.

@end table
@item Data in
@table @file
@item @dataConf
@itemx @dataSupp
@itemx @dataServers
@itemx @dataChecksum
@end table
@end itemize

Example:
@example
*****************************
Mediatex's message of the day
*****************************
Please provide theses local supports:
- AAA: periodic check, coll1
- ZZZ: coll1, coll2
Please burn theses files:
- Collection coll1:
 - /var/cache/mediatex/mdtx1/cache/mdtx1-coll1/aaa (-1.00)
 - /var//cache/mediatex/mdtx1/cache/mdtx1-coll1/zzz (-1.00)
Please remove theses local supports:
- /HERE/misc/logo.png: not used
- SUPP11_logo.png: coll1
@end example

@note
@itemize @bullet
@item First stanza ask @actorPublisherO{} to provide (@eventClientSuppCheck{}) supports either because it wasn't checked for too long time or because it is needed in order to extract some content for a collection.
@item Second stanza ask @actorPublisherO{} to fix some cache content into a new support (@eventClientSuppAdd{} or @eventClientSuppFileAdd{} followed by @eventClientConfShareSupport{}).
@item Third stanza notify @actorPublisherO{} that some supports may be removed because either it is no more used by any collection or because another safe support already include it.
@end itemize
