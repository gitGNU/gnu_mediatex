@cindex exim
@cindex mail

@sc{Mediatex} uses @sc{Exim4} 
(@pxref{Top,,, spec, Specification of the Exim Mail Transfer Agent})
to send mails so as to warm @actorUserO{}
the archives he was looking for is available.
Please configure Exim (or any other mail agent) so as your host will 
relay local mails to the outside ; at least as a ``smart-host'' do.

Process conceptual model:

@image{mediatex-figures/exim,,,,}

@itemize @bullet
@item Events in
@table @code
@item @eventToolsEximSendMail 
from @procScriptsDeliver
@end table

@item Events out
@table @code
@item @eventActorUserMail 
to 
@actorUser{}: when an archive becomes available into the cache.
@item @eventActorAdminMail
to 
@actorAdmin{}: when @procToolsCron{} complains
@end table

@end itemize
